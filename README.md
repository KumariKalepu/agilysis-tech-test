# Agilysis Technical Test
Welome to the Agilysis technical test.

## Instructions
Please clone this to your own repo before you begin. 

You will need PHP 7.3 installed on your local machine as well as a Web server (IIS or Apache) to run the Web application. 

You are free to use any tools that you wish to, but please do not use any PHP frameworks such as Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symphony etc. We recognise the value of such frameworks, and use them in our day to day activities but this test is designed to assess your capabilities with PHP7, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. As such we would prefer not to receive submissions that are framework based.  

## Test Instructions
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/cm392352/agilysis-tech-test/wiki) for further instructions on completing the test.
